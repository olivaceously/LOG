# LOG - Lichens Overthrowing Google

Lichens Overthrowing Google (LOG) is a Google Chrome browser extension that replaces all instances/variations of the word 'like' with 'lichen', as well as all photos with images of lichen. 

This creation of this extension is solely for academic purposes, and for the increased awareness of lichen on the web. Google Chrome browser extensions are easily created and easily made malicious. This particular extension has high permissions and replaces content on any web page with images or the word "like" on it.
